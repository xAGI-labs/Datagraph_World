# Datagraph World

**Compare AI, Earn Crypto. A Sybil-Resistant Data Network Powered by World ID.**

Datagraph World is a decentralized platform that rewards users for contributing to the evaluation and improvement of AI models. By leveraging World ID for Sybil resistance and World Chain for fast, gas-free transactions, we are building a transparent and incentivized ecosystem for human-AI interaction data.

## The Pitch (for Hackathon Judges)

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, high-quality, human-verified data is the most valuable resource. Existing data collection methods are often centralized, lack transparency, and fail to reward the users who provide the data. 

Datagraph World solves this by creating a decentralized data network where anyone can contribute to AI evaluation and be rewarded for their efforts. We use **World ID** to ensure that every contributor is a unique human, preventing Sybil attacks and guaranteeing data quality. All rewards are paid out seamlessly on **World Chain**, making the process fast, efficient, and gas-free for the user. This project represents a paradigm shift in data collection‚Äîfrom centralized exploitation to decentralized collaboration.

## What it Does

*   **üß† AI Model Comparison:** Users are presented with prompts and can compare the responses of various leading AI models side-by-side.
*   **‚ú® Vibe Points System:** For each comparison submitted, users earn "Vibe Points," an in-app currency that represents their contribution to the network.
*   **üíπ Crypto Trading:** Users can trade their Vibe Points for real cryptocurrency (WLD and USDC) directly within the app.
*   **‚õìÔ∏è On-Chain Payments:** All trades are executed as real cryptocurrency transactions on the World Chain, sent directly to the user's wallet.
*   **üìä User Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard shows users their stats, including comparisons completed, day streaks, and total earnings.
*   **üîí World ID Authentication:** Secure, Sybil-resistant login using World ID ensures that all contributions are from unique individuals.

## How We Built It

*   **Frontend:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (React), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a modern, responsive user experience.
*   **Onchain Toolkit:** We used [OnchainKit](https://onchainkit.xyz/) to simplify interactions with the blockchain.
*   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes provide the server-side logic.
*   **Database:** [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is our ORM for interacting with a PostgreSQL database, managing user data, comparisons, and payments.
*   **Authentication:** **World ID** is at the core of our platform, providing secure and Sybil-resistant user authentication.
*   **Blockchain:** We are deployed on **World Chain** to enable fast, scalable, and gas-free transactions for our users.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   Yarn, npm, or pnpm

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
